# Dev
- This module / lecturer uniquely requires us to use our school email for git
- Make sure to change your git email to your school one with  
```git config --global user.email "email_here```
- Also recommended to add this email to your github account, if you want to avoid having 2 accounts and keeping all your work under the same acc(recommended)
- Can omit the --global if you don't want to effect other repositories, or you can setup .envrc to export it automatically when entering the repo
